# iop: A Flexible Framework for Building Web Applications with Elm

iop is a sophisticated framework designed to enhance the development of web applications using Elm. It extends the capabilities of the elm-spa framework, focusing on performance, flexibility, and developer experience. With a suite of improvements and an intuitive CLI, iop streamlines the development process, making it easier and faster to build robust, scalable Elm applications.

## Key Improvements

iop advances beyond elm-spa with developer-centric enhancements:

- **Faster Builds**: Streamlines compilation for improved efficiency.
- **Partial Builds**: Incremental compilation targets only modified files, reducing build times.
- **Centralized Source Code**: Consolidates generated code in `src/`, solving language server error issues.
- **Library Independence**: Full customization flexibility; unchanged hash comments (`{- HASH -}`) skip regeneration.
- **Error Reporting**: Improves visibility of Elm compilation errors.
- **ACL Management**: Implements detailed access control, enabling precise permission settings.
- **Page Layouts**: Offers a modular layout system for dynamic UI design.
